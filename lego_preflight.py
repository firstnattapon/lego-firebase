"""AUTO_SUBMIT readiness gate — validation only, never submission.

The deploy checklist used to live outside the code: a human was expected to move
the token off /tmp, set LEGO_DNA_ORIGIN_UTC, switch the clock to `market` and
check the DNA headroom *before* flipping AUTO_SUBMIT. Nothing enforced any of
it, so the flag alone decided whether a committed row became an order intent —
every unmet condition was a silent fail-open.

This module turns that checklist into the thing that answers the question. It is
deliberately pure: no RTDB, no broker, no environment reads of its own, no
writes. It cannot raise either — an input it cannot read is a *failed check*,
because a validator that throws would hand the caller an error path that skips
the gate entirely.
