"""Move finished order records off the paths the live loops scan.

list_actionable and pending_audits each read a whole RTDB path and filter in
Python. That is correct and cheap while the path is small, and it stays correct
forever — but not cheap: every slot adds one intent and one audit, so after a
year the order worker downloads thousands of finished records on every tick to
find at most a handful of live ones, and the dashboard pays the same cost on
every page load.

Records are moved, never deleted, so the history stays queryable at
*_archive; only the working set shrinks. Two records are always left in place:
anything a human still has to answer (needs_manual_check) and anything that
carries no usable timestamp — an undatable record is never old enough to move.
