"""Why `จำนวนถือครอง (หุ้น)` read 8.78392 on all 37 rows of the export.

2026-07-29 16:25Z → 2026-07-30 18:45Z, AAPL, DNA step 63 → 99, market clock, one
row per 15-minute slot with no gap. Thirty-three of those rows are
TRIGGER_ACTION — twelve READY_SELL, twenty-one READY_BUY — and every one of them
carries `cashflow_status=PENDING_EXECUTION`. Not one order was ever sent, so the
broker position never moved and the column repeated 8.78392 for a day and a half.
ΔAₙ/Aₙ/Eₙ are 0.0 on all 37 rows for the same reason: nothing filled.

The Cloud Logging export of the same window names the block outright::

    lego warning kind=auto_submit_blocked token ยังไม่พร้อม: … ไม่พบ token file
    ที่ /tmp/webull_token/token.txt … {'row_status': 'READY_BUY',
    'clock_mode': 'market', 'blocked_by': ['token_ready']}

…and, on every SDK call in the same window, the reason there was no file::

    webull.core.http.initializer.client_initializer INFO
    _check_token_enable result is False

`ClientInitializer.init_token` asks the broker whether token checking is enabled
and returns before `TokenManager` is ever constructed when the answer is no.
On this UAT app the answer is always no: token.txt is never written, never will
be, and the SDK signs with HMAC alone — which is why the very same invocation
went on to read the account position successfully (the only errors in the window
are transient `GATEWAY_TIMEOUT` 504s on `/openapi/assets/positions`, which
`_retry_transient` recovered from — every slot in the export committed).

`token_health()` scored that missing file as "nothing to sign with", so
`auto_submit_preflight` refused the token and `lego_one_row` committed a
READY_BUY/READY_SELL row with `outbox_blocked=['token_ready']` on every slot.

These tests pin both halves:

* the decision math is bit-identical to the export — the engine was never wrong,
  and this fix must not move a single column;
* every TRIGGER_ACTION row of that export now becomes an order intent, reaches
  the broker, and moves the position.
